# 👋 Hey, I’m Aman

I’m an **SDET / QA engineer** who enjoys **breaking things, understanding systems, and slowly building better automation**.

This GitHub is my **learning and building space** — where I practice, experiment, and improve my skills in **Java, Selenium, and test automation**, while exploring how real software systems behave.

---

## 🧪 What I’m Interested In

- Test automation using **Java + Selenium**
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable test code
- Understanding system behavior beyond happy paths
- Making tests stable, simple, and meaningful
- Learning how development and testing fit together

---

## 🛠️ Currently Practicing

- Core Java fundamentals
- Selenium WebDriver basics
- Git & GitHub workflows
- Page Object Model (POM)
- Writing small, focused automation scripts

---

## 📂 About This GitHub

You’ll find:
- Practice repositories
- Automation experiments
- Learning notes
- Small utilities and test scripts
- Progress over time (not perfection)

Some projects may look simple — that’s intentional.  
This profile reflects **real learning**, not just polished demos.

## 🚧 Work in Progress Projects

Most of my **under-development and upcoming projects** are listed behind a waitlist here:

👉 **https://projektnotify.vercel.app**

I use this as a simple way to:
- Track ideas before public release
- Share early access with interested users
- Build projects gradually without rushing them

---

## 🌱 How I Learn

- Build → break → fix → refactor
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Improve one concept at a time
- Focus on fundamentals before frameworks
